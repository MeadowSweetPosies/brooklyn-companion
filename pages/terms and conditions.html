<p>(a)            <strong>If what you have bought is faulty or misdescribed (subject to clause <a href="#_Products_may_vary">4.1</a>) you may have a legal right to end the contract </strong>(or to get the product repaired or replaced or a service re-performed or to get some or all of your money back), <strong>see <em>clause</em></strong> <a href="#_If_there_is">10</a>;</p>
<p>(b)           <strong>If you want to end the contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do,</strong> <strong>see <em>clause</em></strong> <a href="#_Ending_the_contract_1">7.2</a>;</p>

<p>(b)           we have told you about an error in the price or description of the product you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed;</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc456548114"></a>11.               Price and payment</h4>
<p>11.1             <strong>Where to find the price for the product</strong>. The price of the product (which includes VAT) will be the price indicated on the order pages when you placed your order. We [take all reasonable care to ensure OR use our best efforts to ensure] that the price of the product advised to you is correct. However please see clause <a href="#_What_happens_if">11.3</a> for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the product you order.</p>
<p>11.2             <strong>We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT</strong>. If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and the date we supply the product, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the product in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.</p>
<p>11.3             <strong>What happens if we got the price wrong</strong>. It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product's correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product's correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you.</p>
<p>11.4             <strong>When you must pay and how you must pay</strong>. We accept payment with Visa Debit, Visa Credit, MasterCard, PayPal. When you must pay depends on what product you are buying:</p>

If you do not make any payment to us by the due date we may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 5% a year above the base lending rate of Barclays Bank PLC from time to time. This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest together with any overdue amount.</p>
<p>11.6             <strong>What to do if you think an invoice is wrong</strong>. If you think an invoice is wrong please contact us promptly to let us know and we will not charge you interest until we have resolved the issue.</p>
<h4><a name="_Toc456548115"></a>12.               Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you</h4>
<p>12.1             <strong>We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us</strong>. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen, for example, if you discussed it with us during the sales process.</p>
<p>12.2             <strong>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so</strong>. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; for breach of your legal rights in relation to the products as summarised at clause <a href="#_Summary_of_your">10.2</a> and for defective products under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.</p>
<p>12.3             <strong>When we are liable for damage to your property</strong>. If we are providing services in your property, we will make good any damage to your property caused by us while doing so. However, we are not responsible for the cost of repairing any pre-existing faults or damage to your property that we discover while providing the services.</p>
<h4><a name="_Toc456548116"></a>13.               How we may use your personal information</h4>
<p>13.1             <strong>How we will use your personal information</strong>. We will use the personal information you provide to us:</p>
<p>(a)            to supply the products to you;</p>
<p>(b)           to process your payment for the products; and</p>
<p>(c)            if you agreed to this during the order process, to give you information about similar products that we provide, but you may stop receiving this at any time by contacting us.</p>
<p>13.2             <strong>We will only give your personal information to third parties where the law either requires or allows us to do so</strong>.</p>

<p>14.2             <strong>You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else</strong>.

We may not agree if such person is outside of our then current areas of delivery of the products.</p>
<p>14.3             <strong>Nobody else has any rights under this contract</strong>. This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.  Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these terms.</p>
<p>14.4             <strong>If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force</strong>. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>14.5             <strong>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later</strong>. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.</p>
<p>14.6             <strong>Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings</strong>. These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts. </p>
